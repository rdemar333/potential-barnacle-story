Jeffery Stannos walked down the stairs of his beach house and was greeted with the beautiful Atlantic ocean. He had only lived here a short while so he was still getting accustomed to the beauty of his surroundings. As he looked down, he saw the glimmering sand as the sun shone down on it and the ripples of the water as the slight breeze came through. Jeffery was a handsome man with perfect complexion and an above-average build. He was tall and dressed very casually for how important of a person he was. The beach house was purchased with money he acquired from his latest software deal where he sold a file compression program from millions. Now he spends his time working on better and faster programs to hopefully beat his currently unbeatable compression rates. However, none of that matters to Jeffery right now, as he is on vacation on California ready to do anything other than program for the next month.
